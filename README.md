# Job-Description-Writer
The 'Get Job Description' Web API enables developers to query and retrieve a list of Job Descriptions by a set of parameters including O*net codes and state data entries. Results include a job description that can be used as-is, or edited as needed to fit the job being posted. Just copy the results and paste wherever you'd like to post your job description.
